FOR USING HALEY.WPF RESOURCES: When using Haley.WPF, please add the below resource dictionary directly. In that case, adding converter is not required as it is already added to haley RD.

#### 2 ---- MODELS:

1. ChangeNotifier - For Managing Changes. Use OnPropertyChanged() or SetProp() methods.

2. EventToCommand - For attaching commands to events in XAML (using interaction).

3. NotifiableCollection - For Using an observable collection to notify changes inside the properties of the elements.

4. IocAP - For Haley Attached properties (to be used in conjunction with HaleyContainers). To use in xaml.

#### 3 ---- CONTAINERS:

1. Use, "ContainerStore.Singleton.Windows" to register and use windows.

2. Use, "ContainerStore.Singleton.Controls" to register and use controls.

3. Use, "ContainerStore.Singleton.DI" to register and resolve for dependency injection cases.

#### 4 ---- NOTIFICATION / DIALOG SERVICE:

1. By default, the dialog service will be registered to containerstore di. Use "var _dservice = ContainerStore.Singleton.DI.Resolve<IDialogService>()" to get the dialog service. 

2. Use dialog service as "bool is_success = _dservice.send("Title","message",DialogMode.Confirmation")". Use different dialog modes, like confirmation, notification, getinput.

3. Also, for getting inputs as string, use "_dservice.receive" which should get user input and returns in "out" object.

#### 5 ---- IMAGE UTILS.

A fully functional image utility is added and can be accessed by the static class "ImageUtils". It is helpful for converting images, reducing pixels and size etc.
